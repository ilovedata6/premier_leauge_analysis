# English Premier League Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the English Premier League dataset. The dataset contains various performance metrics for different teams across multiple seasons.

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to gain insights into team performance, offensive and defensive attributes, and trends across different seasons in the English Premier League.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- `team`: Team name
- `wins`: Number of wins
- `losses`: Number of losses
- ... (and other columns)

## Key Questions Explored
1. What are the basic statistics for numeric columns?
2. Which teams have the highest and lowest wins, losses, and goals?
3. How are offensive attributes distributed among teams?
4. Is there any correlation between wins and offensive attributes?
5. How do defensive attributes relate to goals conceded?
6. How does team performance vary across different seasons?

## Methodology
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Descriptive statistics and visualization
3. Correlation analysis
4. Seasonal trends analysis

## Findings
- Teams A and B have the highest number of wins, while teams X and Y have the lowest.
- There's a positive correlation between on-target scoring attempts and wins.
- Clearances have an interesting relationship with goals conceded, suggesting a potential defensive strategy.

## Conclusion
This EDA provides valuable insights into team performance and attributes within the English Premier League. The findings can contribute to a better understanding of factors affecting team success.
